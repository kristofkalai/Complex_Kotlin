# Complex_Kotlin
A small library (written in Kotlin) to demonstrate the Kotlin development.

This repository contains only one class ([Complex](https://github.com/stateman92/Complex_Kotlin/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/Complex.kt)). With this you can work with complex numbers in your app, and since it is written in Kotlin, you can use it from Java too of course.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me or make a PR!

The class is fully covered with tests (see the [tests](https://github.com/stateman92/Complex_Kotlin/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/ComplexTest.kt)).
