# Complex_Kotlin
A small library (written in Kotlin) to demonstrate the Kotlin development.

This repository contains only one class (Complex). With this you can work with complex numbers in your app, and since it is written in Kotlin, you can use it from Java too of course.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me!

The class is fully covered with tests.
